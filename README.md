**Last Updated:** February 14, 2026

## Overview

This extension stores all data in your browser. Nothing is sent to any server.

## What Gets Stored In Your Browser

Chrome saves these settings in your browser:

- Your streak timer (when you started, if it's running)
- Sites you added to block
- Reddit subreddits you want blocked
- Which image type you selected
- Whether the blocker is on or off

This data stays in your browser on your device. We cannot access it.

## What We Don't Collect

We don't collect any data. No analytics, no tracking, nothing.

## Images

When a site gets blocked, you see an image from:

- **Pexels** - Free photo service
- **Nekos.best** - If you selected anime mode

These services don't receive any personal information.

## Site Blocking List

The extension downloads a public list of adult sites from OISD once per day. This list is saved in your browser.

## Amazon Affiliate Links

We show product recommendations with Amazon affiliate links. We may earn a commission if you purchase through these links. Amazon tracks clicks through their own system. You don't have to use these links.

## Chrome Sync

If you use Chrome Sync, your settings may sync to your other devices through Google's service. We don't control this.

## Deleting Your Data

Use "Clear All Data" in Settings to delete everything. Or uninstall the extension.

## Contact
